<p class="#"><i>Dear visitor,</i></p><p class="#" style="margin-left:48px;">

Welcome to my site—I'm Kevin<sup><a class="thumbnail" href="#">?<span><img src="assets/MEEEE.jpg"/></span></a></sup>. I'm an MA student in <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities" target="_blank">Digital Humanities</a> at the CUNY Graduate Center, and product designer at MongoDB. I currently reside in New York City.
<br /><br />
My academic research considers the ways in which the afterlives of anti-black violence condition philosophical and socio-political engagements with technology, and is loosely situated at the intersections of black studies, critical and literary theory, affect theory, new media studies, and the history of technology (especially of digitality). My current research explores how the singularity of Blackness problematizes and reveals the liberal universalist worldview that subtends contemporary digital (humanist) practice. Focusing especially on recent interventions in data visualization, this work highlights the limitations in attempting to "humanize"—that is, reveal the social construction of—data.
<br /><br />
By day and training a digital designer, I received my BA from UC Berkeley, where I studied Design Studies and New Media. While there, I was involved in academic design research<sup><button class="thumbnail" href="#">?<span>I held two design research positions:<ul><li>Design Research Assistant for <a href="https://bravo.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">The BRAVO Group</a>, Summer & Fall 2018. Supervised by Prof. Euiyoung Kim.</li><li>Undergraduate Researcher at the <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Haas School of Business</a>, Fall 2017 to Spring 2019. Supervised by Prof. Sara Beckman and Dr. Rachel Dzombak.</li></ul></span></button></sup> and design consulting<sup><button class="thumbnail" href="#">?<span>I was a member of two undergraduate-led design consultancies:<ul><li><a href="https://www.berkeleyinnovation.org/" target="_blank">Berkeley Innovation</a>, Spring & Fall 2018.</li><br><li><a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a>, Fall 2017 to Spring 2019.</li></ul></span></button></sup>. I also co-taught/started a course at the <a href="http://bcnm.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Center for New Media</a> titled <a href="assets/bdt_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">"Beyond Design Thinking: Technology Through a Critical Lens"</a>.

If you want to reach me, you can email me at <a href="mailto:kevintpham1231@gmail.com" target="_blank">kevintpham1231[at]gmail[dot]com</a>. I'm particularly open to volunteering my time for any radical/activist organizations; I'd be glad to help out where I can. Regardless—thanks for stopping by.
