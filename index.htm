<p>[Last Updated: 12/12/2020]<br><br>
<i>Dear visitor,</i></p><p style="margin-left:48px;">

Welcome to my site—I'm <a class="thumbnail" href="#/">Kevin<span><img src="assets/MEE.JPG"/></span></a> (he/him). I'm a product designer at MongoDB and a graduate student at the CUNY Graduate Center. I currently reside in New York City.
<br /><br />

I received my BA from UC Berkeley, where I studied Design Studies and New Media. While there, I focused my studies on the history and theory of digital media and design, and co-taught/started a course at the <a href="http://bcnm.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Center for New Media</a> titled <a href="assets/bdt_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">"Beyond Design Thinking: Technology Through a Critical Lens."</a> I was also involved in 

<button class="thumbnail">academic design research<span>I held two design research positions:<ul><li>Design Research Assistant for <a href="https://bravo.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">The BRAVO Group</a>, Summer & Fall 2018. Supervised by Prof. Euiyoung Kim.</li><li>Undergraduate Researcher at the <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Haas School of Business</a>, Fall 2017 to Spring 2019. Supervised by Prof. Sara Beckman and Dr. Rachel Dzombak.</li></ul></span></button> and 

<button class="thumbnail">design consulting<span>I was a member of two undergraduate-led design consultancies:<ul><li><a href="https://www.berkeleyinnovation.org/" target="_blank">Berkeley Innovation</a>, Spring & Fall 2018.</li><br><li><a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a>, Fall 2017 to Spring 2019.</li></ul></span></button>.

<br><br>

I'm now pursuing an MA at the CUNY Graduate Center's <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities" target="_blank">Digital Humanities program</a></li>. My research interests generally intersect between continental philosophy, critical race theory (especially Black critical theory), queer theory, computational media, and digital culture. Understood together, I'm interested in exploring the ways in which the afterlives of anti-black and racial violence condition philosophical and cultural engagements with technology. Questions I consider include: What are the relationships between anti-blackness, Western metaphysics, and digitality? How are desire, anxiety, and technology entangled? What does violence and resistance look like in digital spaces?
<br /><br />
You can usually find me trying to figure things out and connect the dots on my <a href="https://www.are.na/kevin-pham" target="_blank">Are.na</a> in addition to my usual 

<button class="thumbnail" href="#">reading<span>I'm currently reading:<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/ontological-terror" target="_blank"> <i>Ontological Terror</i></a> by Calvin L. Warren</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-white-and-black" target="_blank"> <i>Red, White & Black</i></a> by Frank B. Wilderson III</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674030688" target="_blank"> <i>Saltwater Slavery</i></a> by Stephanie E. Smallwood</li>
</ul></span></button>. 

More cohesive thoughts are articulated through my writing, which I plan to begin posting on here sometime in the near future.
<br /><br />
While I consistently drop resources on Are.na, I also work together with some friends to collect <a href="https://cutt.ly/resources-for-blm" target="_blank">BLM-related resources</a> on a Notion workspace. The page is a growing compilation of resources shared by and produced for the Black Lives Matter movement: It includes lists of educational resources, places to donate, mutual aid networks, and much more. We also have some less-organized resources on an <a href="https://www.are.na/ha-duong/abolitionist-imaginaries" target="_blank">Are.na channel</a>. I encourage you to check out these pages, and participate where you can in the movements for Black lives and police/prison abolition.
<br /><br />
If you want to reach me, you can email me at <a href="mailto:kevintpham1231@gmail.com" target="_blank">kevintpham1231[at]gmail[dot]com</a>. I'm particularly open to volunteering my time for any radical/activist organizations that need design, research, or writing assitance—I'd be glad to help out where I can.
<br /><br />
Regardless of who you are, stay safe out there! I tend to update and play around with this site frequently as a way to procrastinate on other things, so I'll keep you posted.
<br />
