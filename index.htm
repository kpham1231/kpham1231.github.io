Dear lovely visitor,
<br /><br />
Welcome to my site! I'm Kevin (he/him)—product designer on the Realm team at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, and recent graduate in Design Studies and New Media from UC Berkeley.
While at Cal, I held design research positions at <a href="https://bravo.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">The BRAVO Group</a>
and the <a href="https://bravo.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Haas School of Business</a>,
as well as a co-founded and taught <a href="https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4799" target="_blank">a course on design theory, history, and ethics</a> 
under the <a href="http://bcnm.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley Center for New Media</a>.<br /><br />
  
Outside of design, my personal interests generally revolve around 
race, contemporary protests/activisms, digital culture, philosophies of technology, and minoritarian subjectivity & world-building.
Understood cohesively, I'm interested in the ways digital spaces are socio-politically constructed/designed along racialized and gendered lines, 
yet also hold the potential to foster community, collaboration, and social movement. 
You can find me trying to connect the dots on my <a href="https://www.are.na/kevin-pham" target="_blank">are.na</a>.
<br /><br />
What I'm up to these days:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Helping curate <a href="https://cutt.ly/resources-for-blm" target="_blank">BLM resources</a> with some friends while continuously sharpening my own abolitionist politic</li>
  <li>Currently reading <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479830374/becoming-human/" target="_blank"> <i>Becoming Human</i></a> by Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, 
<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/scenes-of-subjection-9780195089844?cc=us&lang=en&" target="_blank"> <i>Scenes of Subjection</i></a> by Saidiya Hartman, and 
<a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479809783/the-exquisite-corpse-of-asian-america/" target="_blank"> <i>The Exquisite Corpse of Asian America</i></a> by Rachel C. Lee</li>
  <li>Taking classes as a non-degree student at the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities" target="_blank"> <i>CUNY Digital Humanities program</i></a> (I'll be tracking any sporadic thoughts I have from these classes on an are.na channel)</li>
  <li>Trying to up my dev game with <a href="https://designcode.io/" target="_blank"> <i>designcode.io</i></a></li>
  <li>Getting back into writing and building the confidence to post them on this site...</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />

Anyways, thanks for stopping by. If you need anything, feel free to reach me at kevintpham1231 at gmail dot com! Hope we can talk soon.
