Dear visitor,
<br /><br />
Welcome to my siteâ€”I'm <dfn>Kevin<button class="dfn-tooltip"><img src="assets/MEE.JPG"></button></dfn> (he/him). I'm a product designer at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/realm" target="_blank">MongoDB Realm</a> and a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/realm" target="_blank">CUNY Graduate Center</a>. I currently reside in New York City.
<br /><br />

I received my BA from UC Berkeley, where I studied Design Studies and New Media. While there, I focused my studies on the history and theory of digital media and design, and co-taught/started a course at the <a href="http://bcnm.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Center for New Media</a> titled <a href="assets/bdt_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">"Beyond Design Thinking: Technology Through a Critical Lens."</a>. I was also involved in  

<dfn2>academic design research<button class="dfn2-tooltip"><p>I held two design research positions:<ul><li>Design Research Assistant for <a href="https://bravo.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">The BRAVO Group</a>, Summer & Fall 2018. Supervised by Prof. Euiyoung Kim.</li><br><li>Undergraduate Researcher at the <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Haas School of Business</a>, Fall 2017 to Spring 2019. Supervised by Prof. Sara Beckman and Dr. Rachel Dzombak.</li></ul></p></button></dfn2> and 

<dfn2>design consulting<button class="dfn2-tooltip"><p>I was a member of two undergraduate-led design consultancies:<ul><li><a href="https://www.berkeleyinnovation.org/" target="_blank">Berkeley Innovation</a>, Spring & Fall 2018.</li><br><li><a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a>, Fall 2017 to Spring 2019.</li></ul></p></button></dfn2> work.
<br /><br />
I'm now pursuing an MA at the CUNY Graduate Center's <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities" target="_blank">Digital Humanities program</a></li>. My research interests today generally intersect between continental philosophy, race, digital media, visual culture, and world-building/destroying. Understood together, I'm interested in the ways histories of racial & anti-black violence precede and orient contemporary digital culture and philosophies of technology: What is the relationship between race, anti-blackness, Western metaphysics, and digitality? How are desire, anxiety, and technology entangled? What does care, community, resistance, and violence look like in digital spaces?
<br /><br />
You can usually find me trying to figure things out and connect the dots on my <a href="https://www.are.na/kevin-pham" target="_blank">Are.na</a> in addition to my usual 

<dfn2>reading<button class="dfn2-tooltip"><p>These days, I've been reading:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/ontological-terror" target="_blank"> <i>Ontological Terror</i></a> by Calvin L. Warren</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-white-and-black" target="_blank"> <i>Red, White & Black</i></a> by Frank B. Wilderson III</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674030688" target="_blank"> <i>Saltwater Slavery</i></a> by Stephanie E. Smallwood</li>
</ul>
</p></button></dfn2>. 

More cohesive thoughts are articulated through my writing, which I plan to begin posting on here sometime in the near future.
<br /><br />
While I consistently drop resources on Are.na, I also work together with some friends to collect <a href="https://cutt.ly/resources-for-blm" target="_blank">BLM-related resources</a> on a Notion workspace. The page is a growing compilation of resources shared by and produced for the Black Lives Matter movement: It includes lists of educational resources, places to donate, mutual aid networks, and much more. We also have some less-organized resources on an <a href="https://www.are.na/ha-duong/abolitionist-imaginaries" target="_blank">Are.na channel</a>. I encourage you to check out these pages, and participate where you can in the movements for Black lives and police/prison abolition.
<br /><br />
If you want to reach me, you can email me at <a href="mailto:kevintpham1231@gmail.com" target="_blank">kevintpham1231[at]gmail[dot]com</a>. I'm particularly open to volunteering my time for any radical/activist organizations that need design, research, or writing assitanceâ€”I'd be glad to help out where I can.
<br /><br />
Regardless of who you are, stay safe out there! I tend to update and play around with this site frequently as a way to procrastinate on other things, so I'll keep you posted.
<br /><br />
With love,<br />
Kevin<br><br>
