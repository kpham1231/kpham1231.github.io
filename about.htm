<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src=me.jpg alt=“Me” width=35% height=35%>

<p class="box"><span>
4th year undergrad at UC Berkeley studying New Media and Cognitive Science.  
Previously an instructor for a <a href="https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4799" target="_blank">
design theory course</a>, and a product design intern for <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> 
(where I'll be working full-time starting the Summer of 2020). He/Him.<br /><br />
  
Interests lying somewhere at the intersections of 
interaction design, digital media, science & technology studies, and critical theory.
Also fascinated by fandoms, anime, and fashion. Uses Twitter, but won't share it here because it's ... really embarassing...<br /><br />
