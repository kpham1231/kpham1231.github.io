<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src=me.jpg alt=“Me” width=35% height=35%>

<p class="box"><span>
I’m a 3rd year undergrad at UC Berkeley studying 
New Media and Cognitive Science, with interests lying 
at the intersection of design studies, STS, and media
theory. In the past, I was an instructor for a <a href="https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4799" target="_blank">
design theory course</a>, and a product design intern at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. 
I'll be returning to MongoDB as product designer post-graduation. He/Him.<br /><br />

I currently reside in Berkeley for school, but grew up
in San Diego. I have two dogs back there named Sandi
and Ego — names decided by my mother.<br /><br />

Feel free to reach me at kevintpham1231 at berkeley dot edu.
