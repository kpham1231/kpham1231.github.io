<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src=me.jpg alt=“Me” width=35% height=35%>

<p>I’m a 3rd year undergrad at UC Berkeley studying<br>
New Media and Cognitive Science, with interests lying<br>
at the intersection of design studies, STS, and media<br>
theory. I currently co-teach a <a href="https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4799" target="_blank">design theory course</a> at Cal, <br> and
will be a product design intern at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>. He/Him.</p>

<p>I currently reside in Berkeley for school, but grew up<br>
 in San Diego. I have two dogs back there named Sandi<br>
and Ego — names decided by my mother.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from you, so feel free to reach me at <br>
kevintpham1231 at berkeley dot edu.</p>
